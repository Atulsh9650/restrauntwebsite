1)first i created my index page
in index page i choose my brand name as FlavorFiesta Bistro and then i create maindiv which contains other follwing divs
first it was diificult to centre the miidle div then i used flexbox in main background so that i can align item as i want
i choose flex direction as colums as i wanted divs stacked.
i made item div flex row which contains other pages link as well
i also added hover event so that when user click on it then it changes color and text size.
i also added one logo for my website asw well which i positioned using absolute.

2)second i made menu page
this page was little diificult  to make
i first added header which contains other pages link and also added hover event to the link
i made another css file to style and linked that too
used linear gradient to make background image for food-items div
i used display grid propery to align all my food items boxes
i created 5 columns for food items using grid-template-columns property
i also added hover event to food name so when user clicks on it it shows different color and size

3)then i made aboutus and contactus page
in both pages i added headers and user various font family and gradient colors to make it look good
i used form in contact us page  and set it in middle by using position absolute.
i also used list in about us page to make headings and font family,text-decorations property as well
